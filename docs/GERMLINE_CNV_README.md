The Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC) Germline Copy Number Variant (CNV)
Workflow is a common workflow language (CWL) implmentation to generate CNV
calls from an aligned reads BAM or CRAM file. The workflow makes use of
CNVnator and GATK to call variants.

## Relevant Softwares and Versions

- [CNVnator](https://github.com/abyzovlab/CNVnator): `0.4.1`
- [GATK](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk): `4.2.0.0`

### CNVnator

CNVnator is a read-depth (RD) based method for CNV discovery and genotyping.
The method is based on combining the established mean-shift approach with
additional refinements (multiple-bandwidth partitioning and GC correction) to
broaden the range of discovered CNVs. Overall, for CNVs accessible by RD,
CNVnator has high sensitivity (86%-96%), low false-discovery rate (3%-20%),
high genotyping accuracy (93%-95%), and high resolution in breakpoint discovery
(<200 bp in 90% of cases with high sequencing coverage). Furthermore, CNVnator
is complementary in a straightforward way to split-read and read-pair
approaches: It misses CNVs created by retrotransposable elements, but more than
half of the validated CNVs that it identifies are not detected by split-read or
read-pair.

### GATK gCNV

GATK gCNV is a methodology and suite of software for discovering rare and
common CNVs from next-generation sequencing (NGS) read-depth (RD) data. In GATK
gCNV, sequencing bases are modeled via negative-binomial factor analysis, and
copy-number states and genomic regions of high and low CNV activity are modeled
using a hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM). Automatic differentiation
variational inference (ADVI) and variational message passing are used to infer
continuous and discrete latent variables in a principled framework. A
deterministic annealing protocol is used to deal with the non-convexity of the
variational objective function.

## Input Files

- Universal
    - `aligned_reads`: The germline BAM/CRAM input that has been aligned to a reference genome.
    - `indexed_reference_fasta`: The reference genome fasta (and associated indicies) to which the germline BAM/CRAM was aligned.
    - `intervals/blacklist_intervals`: Intervals to include or exclude from analysis
- GATK
    - `contig_ploidy_model_tar`: The contig-ploidy model directory generated by the DetermineGermlineContigPloidyCohortMode task in the Cohort workflow.
    - `gcnv_model_tars`: Array of tars of the contig-ploidy model directories generated by the GermlineCNVCallerCohortMode tasks in the Cohort workflow.

## Output Files

- CNVnator
    - `cnvnator_vcf`: Called CNVs in VCF format
    - `cnvnator_called_cnvs`: Called CNVs from `aligned_reads`
    - `cnvnator_average_rd`: Average RD stats
- GATK
    - `gatk_gcnv_genotyped_intervals_vcfs`: Per sample VCF files provides a detailed listing of the most likely copy-number call for each genomic interval included in the call-set, along with call quality, call genotype, and the phred-scaled posterior probability vector for all integer copy-number states.
    - `gatk_gcnv_genotyped_segments_vcfs`: Per sample VCF files containing coalesced contiguous intervals that share the same copy-number call
    - `gatk_gcnv_denoised_copy_ratios`: Per sample files concatenates posterior means for denoised copy ratios from all the call shards produced by the GermlineCNVCaller
